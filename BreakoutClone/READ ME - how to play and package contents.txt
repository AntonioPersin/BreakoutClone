Game:

Start screen contains previous run score (of current play session) and has 2 controls.
Space to start playing or ESC to close the game.

Game begins on level 0 with default brick configuration. When the player beats the level,
new level is randomly chosen between 9 available levels which vary in difficulty. Once that 
level is beaten, a new level is chosen again. Game lasts until player reaches a score limit.
(currently 69 420, which depending on the levels generated would be about 12-14 levels)

Player moves the paddle with A and D keys and has 3 lives. Losing a life pauses the game
until player presses Spacebar which resets the ball and continues. 
Pressing Q returns the player to start screen without saving progress.

Game should run if Visual C++ redistributable package is updated. (installer provided)
